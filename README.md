In order to split the data into train, valid and test, run data_processing.py.

The model can be trained and saved by running main_train.py.

The trained model can be loaded and be used on the test set with a greedy decoding using main_test_greedy.py.

In a similar way, the trained model can be loaded and be used on the test set with a beam search decoding using main_test_beam.py.
